hi guys

pleaso do familiarize yourself with **git versioning tool**, or just github desktop if youre lazy

## we shouldnt do "add files via upload" or "Update xxx.xx"

please create your own branches and test your own part there and, when youre sure its working, commit and push to **release** branch (sorry but main branch is occupied by ziniu and shaun)

**fetch and pull** from release and commit, **dont override others code** 

thanks
hope we finish 1d asap
