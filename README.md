hi guys

pleaso do familiarize yourself with **git versioning control** tool, or just github desktop if youre lazy

### *we shouldn't do "add files via upload" or "Update xxx.xx"*

please create your own branches, or fork, and test your own part there and, when you're sure its working, commit and push to **release** branch (sorry main branch is occupied by zi niu and shaun)

**fetch and pull** from release and commit, **don't override others code** 

thanks

hope we finish 1d asap
